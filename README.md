# Recruiting Coordination Process

### Best practices for scheduling interviews at TTS:

* Always refer to the candidate comms page in the wiki for email templates. Schedulers can and should always customize these templates as needed but the basic template/info we share should be consistent

* Make note of the time zone that each candidate is in and use that time zone when communicating with them about availability and interview times

* Interviews should always be scheduled on the Interview Calendar so that everyone on the team has visibility and can jump in to make changes if the scheduler is out or unavailable

* Interviews should be marked “private” so people cannot see candidate names on interviewers calendars

* Interview training and interview and debrief invites for 18F should always have a tock code

* Candidate confirmations should be nicely formatted and consistent in typeface/font. Dates and times of interviews should be bolded. 

* All interviews happening on the same day for the same candidate should use the same Meet link.

* When scheduling a candidate - include the interview questions in the confirmation email you send to them (We can figure out the best way to do this, I dropped these comms at the top of the interview question PDF doc that I shared with candidates)
